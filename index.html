      Hi, I'm <span style="font-weight:bold;">Alison Chan</span>, a person 
      currently living in the suburbs of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit">Detroit</a>, 
      but aspiring to move to the city. I'm a coder, artist, baker, and smof.
    </p>
    <h2>Code</h2>
    <p>
      I'm currently seeking employment. 
      <a href="https://github.com/alis0nc/alisonc-resume/blob/master/resume_full_pub.pdf">Check out my résumé</a>!
      I would like to do something with civic or educational tech, and I mostly 
      have experience in Java, but I'm a quick learner. I haven't done a whole 
      lot of front end stuff from scratch (uh, look at this page...), but I'd 
      love to learn.
      As a Computer Engineering student in college I did quite a bit of embedded work 
      on the Arduino platform as well as a bit of MATLAB, Simulink, and embedded C, and 
      I excelled at that but haven't had many opportunities to continue with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As far as open source projects, I've hacked a bit on the front end of 
      <a href="https://sefaria.org/">Sefaria</a>, an open e-library of Jewish 
      texts. 
    </p>
    <h2>Art</h2>
    <p>
      My friend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/theanimator_/">Rachel Chezick</a> convinced me to take part in 
      <a href="http://www,inktober.com/">Inktober</a> in 2017, a 31-day drawing 
      challenge with a one-word prompt for each day in October. I've posted my 
      progress to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/passport.mid/">my Instagram</a>, 
      but eventually I'll get a proper portfolio page set up on this site.
      In November 2017, I'll be taking part in a 30-day background drawing challenge 
      with her as well.
    </p>
    <h2>Baking</h2>
    <p>
      I made my first challah on 13 October 2017, and it was good. 
    </p>
    <h2>Smofing</h2>
    <p>
      I'm the Head of Logistics for <a href="https://2018.penguicon.org">Penguicon 2018</a>. 
      I was the Assistant Head of Logistics for 2017, and the de facto Assistant Head of 
      Logistics for 2016. Logistics at Penguicon entails working with all the other 
      departments. We need to know what we have in the storage cube, and what needs to 
      go (or not go) to con, and how to get it to con. If Logistics goes down, the whole 
      con goes down, because nobody has their stuff. It's hard but rewarding work.
    </p>
