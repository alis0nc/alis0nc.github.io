[bendyboi-tracker](https://github.com/alis0nc/bendyboi-tracker) is a Discord bot that periodically polls the [SMART Bus](https://smartbus.org) API and sends alerts when specific buses come online. I made it because I like articulated buses (aka bendybois), and SMART lets you track a bus given a fleet number, so I'd be able to know when a bendyboi came in service or out of service.

Want to see it in action? Message me on Discord (`Withonel#1996`) and I'll invite you to the server it runs on!
