[What is this week's Torah portion?](https://whatisthisweekstorahportion.com/) is a little personal project that I made in order to learn more about [React](https://reactjs.org). At Detroit Labs, most of our web projects are React-based, and I came into this job not knowing anything about React, so I had to learn quickly in order to be able to contribute effectively.
