## Learning

- home ownership. mostly how much it costs and how much work is involved. ðŸ˜“
- how to use a pen plotter

## Creating

- I just bought a Panasonic RK-P400C ~~typewriter~~ pen plotter. Once I get it hooked up to a computer with an rs232 adapter and cable, I plan on using it to write [sitelen pona](https://sona.pona.la/wiki/sitelen_pona) and [sitelen sitelen](https://sona.pona.la/wiki/sitelen_sitelen) to make art and correspondence.
- Building [plastic models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_model). Mostly cars, some mecha. You can follow my projects on [Scalemates](https://www.scalemates.com/profiles/mate.php?id=104315), but I'm pretty bad at updating that site.
- [Junkyard scraper](https://github.com/alis0nc/junkyard_scraper): it scrapes the inventory pages of local self-service junkyards for unified search.
- Day job: Software Engineer at [CompanyCam](https://companycam.com/).
