Hi, I'm **Alison Chan**. I'm passionate about public transit, creating art, and shaping communities. I view technology not as an end in itself, but as a means to create and further community and make the world a better place.
I currently live in the western suburbs of [Detroit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit), but I'm planning to move to the city.

## Transit
I'm currently in the process of mapping all the [Detroit Department of Transportation (DDOT)](http://detroitmi.gov/ddot) bus routes for [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/). I'm also a member of [Motor City Freedom Riders](https://motorcityfreedomriders.org/) and [Transportation Riders United](http://www.detroittransit.org/), two organisations advocating for improved public transit in Southeastern Michigan.

## Art
My friend [Rachel Chezick](https://www.instagram.com/theanimator_/) convinced me to take part in [Inktober](http://www.inktober.com/) in 2017, a 31-day drawing challenge with a one-word prompt for each day in October. I've posted my progress to [Instagram @passport.mid](https://www.instagram.com/passport.mid/), and I'm working on getting a portfolio page set up on this site.

## Conventions
I'm the Head of Logistics for [Penguicon 2018](https://2018.penguicon.org/). I was the Assistant Head of Logistics for 2017, and the de facto Assistant Head of Logistics for 2016. Penguicon Logistics involves being the custodian of Penguicon's storage unit, working with nearly every other department of Penguicon to maintain the inventory of con possessions, and coordinating the transportation of all of Penguicon's possessions (plus a huge amount of food that is served in our hospitality suite) from the storage unit to the con venue.
